# MADESON Diagnostic Engine (Canonical Release v1.0.0)

**Multidimensional Archetype Diagnostic for Emotion Signal Orientation & Navigation**

Created and stewarded by **Marc S. Skinner**, this diagnostic engine maps emotional signal orientation across four dimensions using a hyperbolic proximity model. It matches users to one or more of 20 exact archetypes ‚Äî no substitutions, no paraphrasing, no symbolic drift.
