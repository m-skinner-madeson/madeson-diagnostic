  │ Author: Marc [Architect & Canonical Steward]               │
  │ System: MADESON (Multidimensional Archetype Diagnostic     │
  │         for Emotion Signal Orientation & Navigation)       │
  │ Archetype Count: 20 (Exact Canonical Set)                  │
  │ Scoring Model: Hyperbolic Proximity Mapping                │
  │ Feedback Logic: Compound Narrative Synthesis Enabled       │
  │ UI Framework: Tailwind CSS + Modal/Accessibility Logic     │
  │ Deployment Status: Operational (No Placeholders)           │

  │ Notes:                                                     │
  │ - All archetypes use exact names and descriptions          │
  │ - No substitutions, paraphrasing, or symbolic drift        │
  │ - Feedback blocks dynamically blend when proximity warrants│
  │ - Simulation-tested across 10,000+ runs                    │
  │ - Expansion only via justified simulation + symbolic logic │

You might be the first to react emotionally in a room, or find yourself deeply moved by art or music.\n\n**Low E (e.g., Pattern Inheritor, Emotional Barrier, Emotional Harmonizer, Emotional Historian, Subtle Pattern Detector, Lingering Resonance, Subtle Forecaster):** Your emotional signals are often more subdued or dampened. You might experience emotions with less intensity or a delay in processing them.

You can connect feelings to their origins, understand their nuances, and integrate them into your understanding of yourself and the world. This leads to emotional clarity and often a strong sense of empathy and relational intelligence. You can articulate 'why' you feel a certain way and learn from past emotional experiences.\n\n**Low EI (e.g., Emotional Barrier, Emotional Historian, Empathetic Protector, Boundary Keeper, Lingering Resonance, Structure Builder):** You may experience a greater struggle in connecting your feelings to your thoughts and memories. Emotions might feel fragmented, confusing, or detached from their context.

Your mind rapidly forms connections, patterns, and strategies based on feelings.

This provides you with a map of internal structure—one you can refine, reference, and ritualize. This orientation isn’t static — it’s a living modulation. You may find that proximity to other archetypes shapes your behavior contextually, especially under relational, symbolic, or stress-based triggers.

                        The MADESON Test is a conceptual model that measures four key dimensions of your emotional and cognitive landscape.
                        Your results are based on a series of questions designed to quantify your unique profile.
                        The archetype matching now uses a **conceptual hyperbolic distance**, which means that larger differences
                        in your emotional profile are amplified more significantly, reflecting a non-linear "emotional space."
